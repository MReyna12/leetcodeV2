// Pseudocode:
//  1. Create an object that contains letters a-z and numbers 0-9.
//  2. Loop through the string, comparing the lowercase version of the character to the object. If the value exists, then add the character and 1 (or add 1 of already existing) to a new object. If the character does not exist in the object, then go to the next character.
//  3. Loop through the object and if any of the values is an odd number, then return false.
